# MixedMessages
Mixed Messages Project for Codecademy.

This is my first project done formally on my own, I aim to use this project as a vehicle to better understand basic use of Git and Github. 

The project itself is a basic random number generated predictor, it gives you "insight" as to who your true love is and some information about them.

The script will tell you your true loves:
1. Star Sign
2. Day, Month and Season of Birth
3. A number to focus on that will lead you to them.
